# Roadmap

This is the Roadmap of this RulesEngine fork.

- Add CancellationToken Token for Async [Original Project Issue #609](https://github.com/microsoft/RulesEngine/issues/609)
- Add Event to OnFailed
- Enhance and Correct the Wiki
- Refactor Code and add comments for readability
- Fix Issues from the original project
- Go From Moq to NSubstitute 


Somewhat later:
Probably braking changes:
- Migrate from Newtonsoft.Json to System.Text.Json
- Split Rule into LogicalRule and ExpressionRule for easier use
-- With migration script

More to come .. :)
