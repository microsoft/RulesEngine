# Rules Engine

# IMPORTANT: This fork is in the building. There might be information missing or wrong.

# NOTICE: This is a FORK of the RulesEngine project.

It seems not to be actively maintained anymore.
The original project can be found [here]( https://github.com/microsoft/RulesEngine)

I usually donÂ´t work with GitHub, and I am doing this in my free time, so please be patient with me :)<br>Any help is
appreciated.
First of I want to Update to System.Text.Json, .NET 8, remove moq and use NSubstitute Instead.

## Overview

Rules Engine is a library/NuGet package for abstracting business logic/rules/policies out of a system. It provides a
simple way of giving you the ability to put your rules in a store outside the core logic of the system, thus ensuring
that any change in rules don't affect the core system.

## Installation

TBA, this fork was just created (2024.06.20).
So there is no active NuGet package yet.

## How to use it

There are several ways to populate workflows for the Rules Engine as listed below.

You need to store the rules based on
the [schema definition](https://github.com/timophe-91/RulesEngine/blob/main/schema/workflow-schema.json) given, and they
can be stored in any store as deemed appropriate like Azure Blob Storage, Cosmos DB, Azure App
Configuration, [Entity Framework](https://github.com/timophe-91/RulesEngine#entity-framework), SQL Servers, file systems
etc. For RuleExpressionType `LambdaExpression`, the rule is written as
a [lambda expressions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/lambda-expressions).

An example rule:

```json
[
  {
    "WorkflowName": "Discount",
    "Rules": [
      {
        "RuleName": "GiveDiscount10",
        "SuccessEvent": "10",
        "ErrorMessage": "One or more adjust rules failed.",
        "ErrorType": "Error",
        "RuleExpressionType": "LambdaExpression",
        "Expression": "input1.country == \"india\" AND input1.loyaltyFactor <= 2 AND input1.totalPurchasesToDate >= 5000"
      },
      {
        "RuleName": "GiveDiscount20",
        "SuccessEvent": "20",
        "ErrorMessage": "One or more adjust rules failed.",
        "ErrorType": "Error",
        "RuleExpressionType": "LambdaExpression",
        "Expression": "input1.country == \"india\" AND input1.loyaltyFactor >= 3 AND input1.totalPurchasesToDate >= 10000"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

You can inject the rules into the Rules Engine by initiating an instance by using the following code -

```c#
var rulesEngine = new RulesEngine(workflow);
```

Here, *workflow* is a list of deserialized objects based on the schema explained above
Once initialised, the Rules Engine needs to execute the rules for a given input. This can be done by calling the
method `ExecuteAllRulesAsync`:

```c#
List<RuleResultTree> response = await rulesEngine.ExecuteAllRulesAsync(workflowName, input);
```

Here, *workflowName* is the name of the workflow, which is *Discount* in the above-mentioned example. And *input* is the
object which needs to be checked against the rules, which itself may consist of a list of class instances.

The *response* will contain a list of [
*RuleResultTree*](https://github.com/timophe-91/RulesEngine/wiki/Getting-Started#ruleresulttree) which gives information
if a particular rule passed or failed.

_A demo app for the is available at [this location](https://github.com/timophe-91/RulesEngine/tree/main/demo)._

## Basic
<details>
A simple example via code only is as follows:

```c#
List<Rule> rules = new List<Rule>();

Rule rule = new Rule();
rule.RuleName = "Test Rule";
rule.SuccessEvent = "Count is within tolerance.";
rule.ErrorMessage = "Over expected.";
rule.Expression = "count < 3";
rule.RuleExpressionType = RuleExpressionType.LambdaExpression;
rules.Add(rule);

var workflows = new List<Workflow>();

Workflow exampleWorkflow = new Workflow();
exampleWorkflow.WorkflowName = "Example Workflow";
exampleWorkflow.Rules = rules;

workflows.Add(exampleWorkflow);

var bre = new RulesEngine.RulesEngine(workflows.ToArray());
```

</details>

## Entity Framework
<details>
Consuming Entity Framework and populating the Rules Engine is shown in
the [EFDemo class](https://github.com/microsoft/RulesEngine/blob/main/demo/DemoApp/EFDemo.cs) with Workflow rules
populating the array and passed to the Rules Engine, The Demo App includes an
example [RulesEngineDemoContext](https://github.com/microsoft/RulesEngine/blob/main/demo/DemoApp.EFDataExample/RulesEngineDemoContext.cs)
using SQLite and could be swapped out for another provider.

```c#
var wfr = db.Workflows.Include(i => i.Rules).ThenInclude(i => i.Rules).ToArray();
var bre = new RulesEngine.RulesEngine(wfr, null);
```

*Note: For each level of nested rules expected, a ThenInclude query appended will be needed as shown above.*
</details>

## How it works
<details>

![](https://github.com/timophe-91/RulesEngine/blob/main/assets/BlockDiagram.png)

The rules can be stored in any store and be fed to the system in a structure which adheres to
the [schema](https://github.com/timophe-91/RulesEngine/blob/main/schema/workflow-schema.json) of WorkFlow model.

A wrapper needs to be created over the Rules Engine package, which will get the rules and input message(s) from any
store that your system dictates and put it into the Engine. The wrapper then handles the output using appropriate means.
