+ RulesEngine(string[] jsonConfig, ReSettings reSettings = null)

- RulesEngine(Workflow[] Workflows, ILogger logger = null, ReSettings reSettings = null)
+ RulesEngine(Workflow[] Workflows, ReSettings reSettings = null)

- Made certain fields in Rule model optional allowing users to define workflow with minimal fields
- Added option to disable Rule in workflow json
- Added `GetAllRegisteredWorkflow` to RulesEngine to return all registered workflows
- Runtime errors for expressions will now be logged as errorMessage instead of throwing Exceptions by default
